# Adaptive Lighting component

Try out this code by adding https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting to your custom repos in HACS and install it!

I have not written any docs yet, so I recommend to use the UI to add this integration.

See [this video on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/j09219/any_circadian_lighting_users_good_news_i_just/) to see how to add the integration and set the options.
